# AnagramHasher

One way to run is to use tests.

Another is to use Console from AnagramHasher project

## Examples

    AnagramHasher.exe "poultry outwits ants" "e4820b45d2277f3844eac66c903e84be","23170acc097c24edb98fc5488ab033fe","665e5bcb0c20062fe8abaaf4628bb154" "wordlist.txt"
    
To run 3 letter word takes ~20 minutes, so improvement is in order, still finds one phrase which is enough for MVP.
